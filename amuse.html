    <h2>EllenTube</h2>
    <p>Ellen Degeneres has had a talkshow for a very long time. She is now retiring, but she could make anyone laugh. Now that she is ending her show, I like 
        to go to her website, EllenTube and watch funny videos there. My cousin was actually featured on there. The link will take you right to her video!</p>

    <h2>Public Laughd</h2>
    <p> I have recently discovered a site that makes me laugh a lot. It is a meme page where people can post all kinds of funny memes. Some of them are a little 
        Rated R but still funny. It is not for everyone but I think most people would find something on there funny.:</p>
