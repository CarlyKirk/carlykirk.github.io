I have been inspired by a lot of people in my lifetime. The most recent significant inspiratiion has been an author that came to UNCo to speak about his life.
His name is Corey A. Ciocchetti and he wrote "Inspiring Integrity Chase an Authentic Life." You'd think it is a self-help book, but it is much more than that to me nd him.
He and his life story inspires me because he had felt a little lost with where he wanted to go in life. He kept changing what he wanted to do.
All the way from business to law school to becoming a professor. He discusses how to have an authentic and happy life. 
This author inspires me because he taught me how to work towards living an authentic life by having:
1.) a sincere sense of contentment, (2) strong personal relationships, and (3) a solid character. 
This has helped me look critically at my life, as well as, set priorities and goals, develop a solid character, 
avoid serious mistakes and come closer to my true passion in life. 
Learning this "way of life" has changed my perspective on my own life significantly. By hearing about what he believes in has helped me do what I want 
to do. 
Now that he has inspired me to change my life, I have been inspired to share his thoughts with others. He is someone that I truly look up to especially when
I am going through a rough patch in life.
